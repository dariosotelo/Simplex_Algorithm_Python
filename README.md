# Simplex_Algorithm_Python
A friendly code which asks the user element by element to solve a linear programming problem (LPP).

User manual:
1. We have to get ready a linear programming problem and know how to build a matrix based on the coefficients from the restrictions.
2. Have an IDE or a terminal which supports Python and numpy.
3. Run the code.
4. This code is programmed in a way that the user is asked the coefficients of the restrictions, for each of the questions the code makes, the user has to enter an real value and press "ENTER".
5. It will first ask the number of restrictions that the LPP has.
6. Then it will ask for the number of variables in the LPP.
7. It will ask for the coefficients of the variables and use them to make a matrix.
8. It will ask for each of the limit of the restrictions.
9. If the restriction needs a slack variable, the user will have to enter "1", if the restriction needs an excess variable, the user will have to enter "0".
10. It will then ask for the coefficients of the optimization problem function.
11. It will finally ask if the user wants to solve a maximization problem or a minimization problem.
12. Press "ENTER".
